# Vaccine-Delivery-Cleaning
The purpose of this project was to locate publicly available manufacturer level Covid-19 Vaccine Delivery data sources and create ETL pipelines using SQL Server in conjunction with the business intelligence tool Pyramid Analytics. As of April 21, 2022 around 11 billion Covid-19 doses have been delivered globally and this project assigns approximately 4 billion or 36% of those doses to a manufacturer. 
### Brief Summary of ETL Process
1. Extract data from web (Done in Pyramid Analytics) (See source data folder)
2. Conduct simple data preprocessing (Done in Pyramid Analytics). For step-by-step documentation of data see processed data folder.
3. Send partially preprocessed data to SQL Server (Done in Pyramid Analytics). See processed data folder
4. Write SQL query for complex data manipulation
