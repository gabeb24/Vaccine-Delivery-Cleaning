Based on the client needs for this dashboard, all data sources were required to include: The date that doses were delivered and the vaccine manufacturer.
Due to these requirements there are several sources that could not be used because the datasets either did not include the date or the vaccine manufacturer.

As of April 24, 2022 these are all the sources that satisfied our requirements.
